## Generic info:

During the Database Fundamentals course, I created a database for a library. As part of the implementation of practical tasks, the database was developed and improved by me. It has main files: schemas.sql - for tables, populate_data.sql - for data population. There are also additional files such as: queries.sql, subqueries.sql etc. which contain database query templates, useful tools for working with the database, such as procedures.
