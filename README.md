## Generic info:

During the Database Fundamentals course, I created a database for a library. As part of the implementation of practical tasks, the database was developed and improved by me. It has main files: schemas.sql - for tables, populate_data.sql - for data population. There are also additional files such as: queries.sql, subqueries.sql etc. which contain database query templates, useful tools for working with the database, such as procedures.


## Project structure:

All practical assignments are contained in the practical_assignments directory for good visualization and convenient search.

**PA1:** The directory *practical_assignments-> pa1* contains the main components of the database - tables and data for tables (in different files, respectively).

**PA2:** In the directory *practical_assignments-> pa2,* the files *populate_data_updates.sql, queries.sql, schema_updates.sql* are added, which contain changes due to the addition of many to many relationships between tables and several queries.

**PA3:** In the directory *practical_assignments-> pa3,* the file *subqueries.sql* is added, which contains 30 subqueries (delete, select, update) and 4 queries for union/union all/intersect/except, which we wrote in order to get a general understanding of queries and subqueries and practice writing them.

**PA4:** In the directory *practical_assignments-> pa4,* *procedures.sql* and *executions.sql* files are added, which contain procedures and their calls, respectively.

**PA5:** In the directory *practical_assignments-> pa5,* the files *views.sql* and *index.sql* are added, which contain views and creating indexes for effective database searches, respectively.

## About author:

**Anna Oleksandrovych** is a student of *KSE -> ITBA27* who, as part of her studies, took the Database Fundamentals course, and who was lucky enough to get the practical variant closest to her heart - a database for the *library*.
